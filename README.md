Noteshrinker - Django
======

What is this?
------

This a webservice, which is designed to help people keep their notes clean and store them in pretty PDF's.

It shrinks & prettifies the images uploaded, which makes them much easier to work with.

Example
------
Look at the image provided:
![before_after_image](https://github.com/rejgan318/noteshrinker-django/blob/master/example/before_after.jpg?raw=true "Before-After")
Better resolution is available in the "example" folder of this repo. It is not perfect example, it is the one done with the defaults,
yet it can be made better by tweaking settings.

What does it look like?

How do I launch it?
------
### Using Python ###
First of all, get python 3 & then get pip.

Optionally, you could use virtualenv. If you are using virtualenv, do 
```virtualenv venv && source venv/bin/activate ```
and use python instead of python3, and pip instead of pip3

1. [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)
3. Then, clone this repo (attention! it will be cloned to the current directory, so make sure you do it in some kinda documents or special one) ```git clone https://github.com/delneg/noteshrinker-django/ ```
4. Then, ```cd noteshrinker_django``` and ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
5. Tweak the settings in the bottom of the settings.py file.
6. Finally,  from the root directory of the project ```python3 manage.py migrate``` and  ```python3 manage.py runserver ```
7. Navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser!

### Using Docker (not for production) ###
Make sure you have Docker installed.

1. Clone this repository:  
   ```git clone https://github.com/delneg/noteshrinker-django/ ```
2. cd into the newly created directory:  
   ```cd noteshrinker-django```
3. Build the Docker container:  
   ```docker build -t noteshrinker .```
4. Run the container:  
   ```docker run -p 8000:8000 --rm noteshrinker```  
   The container will listen on port 8000 (bound to internal port 8000) and will be removed after use (--rm). The server should be up-and-running immediately but it won't tell you. Just go to the next step.
5. Navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser!
